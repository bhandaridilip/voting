The Voting DApp represents a significant advancement in democratizing the electoral process, offering transparency, security, accessibility, and decentralization. By addressing key challenges of traditional voting systems, it aims to promote fair and inclusive elections while strengthening democratic principles and civic engagement.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
